# Computational-Music

The corpus I've chosen is my own music playlist. The main reason for my choice is due to my inability to understand my own preference in music. I grew up experiencing the importance of having a personal taste in music, especially for social settings and also, if I may put it spiritually, the enrichment of one's soul. It's definitely more than a decade, since I've fervently started to unravel my vague detachment to sound. Therefore, the tantalizing idea of diving deeper into music theory with actual data of my own music, could bring me one step closer in my endeavour to a more comprehensible conclusion. 

My corpus consist of the following genres:
     C-pop 
     J-pop
    K-pop
    Instrumental music (no singing), i.e. Piano
    Dutch-pop
    American pop
    Jazz
    Western Classics, i.e. Queens
    Rap in multiple languages
    Some more random genres, like seasonal tracks


I'm not set yet on what to include, because I've no clear vision of how this project is going to be. The only plausible strategy that I've come up with is sorting songs into a playlist I prefer right now and one I don't prefer, but have listened to. It's important that I've listened to the songs, because I believe if a song doesn't stick, means that I don't like it enough. After the sorting, I analyse all the differences of both playlists. I'll also analyse the albums separately to check what it is about the songs I prefer. Is it just the rythm, valence or maybe something else I'm not aware off.
